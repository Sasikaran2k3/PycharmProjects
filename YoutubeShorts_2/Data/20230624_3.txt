Microsoft Expects Next-Gen Xbox and PS6 to Launch in 2028, Claims It Has Been Losing Console Wars: Report 
Microsoft believes the next generation of gaming consoles should be out in 2028, court documents in the ingoing FTC trial over the Xbox parent's attempt to acquire Activision Blizzard revealed. The documents, as reviewed by IGN, detailed that the next Xbox and PlayStation 6 will potentially be out eight years after the current ones launched in 2020. The timeline coincides with Sony's statement from 2022, which alluded that the next console generation won't be here until 2027. The dates are important, considering Microsoft is trying to convince the court that it is willing to commit to making Activision's biggest franchise Call of Duty available in parity on PlayStation consoles for a 10-year duration.

How to Create Instagram Broadcast Channel on Android, iOS Device 
Instagram parent Meta recently announced about rolling out the Channels features for broadcasting messages. The feature, which has now rolled out globally, was earlier limited to select creators and users. The social media platform started testing the broadcast channels feature in February this year. Through this feature, creators will be able to share text, video and photo updates to the invited and subscribed followers to their broadcast channels. It is to be noted that only creators can send messages in broadcast channels. Followers can only react to content or vote in polls.

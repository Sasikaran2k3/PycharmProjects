Nintendo's next mainline console is reportedly set to launch in the second half of 2024. As per VGC's sources, development kits for the next gaming console have been sent out to ‘key partner studios,' adding that it can be used in portable mode akin to the current Nintendo Switch. It's common for console manufacturers like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to provide test units to developers, way ahead of launch, so they can start making, testing, and optimising games for the said platform. No pricing details were mentioned, but for comparison, the Nintendo Switch was launched at $299.99 (about Rs. 24,684) in the US.

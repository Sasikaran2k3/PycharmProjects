Cast Members of Oppenheimer Leave the London Premiere in Support of the Actors' Strike 
In support of the SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) actors' strike, Oppenheimer's cast left its London premiere late on Thursday. Although there was a lot of excitement about the new Christopher Nolan movie in Leicester Square, the crew had to move the premiere ahead by an hour the night before due to the possibility of a strike. The cast of Oppenheimer left the location to abide by the union's rules since the actors' union was unable to reach a fair agreement with film studios on proper residual payments. The strike was called with a 98 percent vote approval majority.

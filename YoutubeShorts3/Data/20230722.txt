Twitter will soon integrate LinkedIn Twist and enable verified businesses to post job listings. 
Twitter is adding more features, perhaps in an effort to attract more users to the service. The social networking site appears to be developing a brand-new function that would enable verified businesses to list all of their job opportunities on their profiles. While Twitter hasn't formally stated that it is developing this function or that it plans to deliver it anytime soon, some tipsters appear to have observed its tests being conducted with a few select firms. 'Twitter Hiring' is the working title of this unannounced service.

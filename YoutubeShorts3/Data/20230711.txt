Cross-Play Will Be Added to NBA 2K24 for the First Time on September 8 
Cross-play is available between the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X versions of NBA 2K24. For the first time in the 25-year history of the brand, the feature is being added to the renowned basketball sim, enabling players on various platforms to compete against one another. But the PC edition will also be devoid of ProPlay, the new animation system that "directly translates NBA footage into NBA 2K24 gameplay." The game will also have a "Mamba Moments" mode that allows you relive some of Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant's greatest moments in-game. Bryant unfortunately passed away in 2020. On September 8, NBA 2K24 launches across all major platforms.

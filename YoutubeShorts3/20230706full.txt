Ahead of the Camon 20 Premier launch in India, a tipster has suggested its price. According to a tweet by tipster Mukul Sharma (@stufflistings) the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G will likely be priced in India at under Rs. 35,000. The model is offered in Dark Welkin and Serenity Blue colour options. The phone is set to go on sale via Amazon.

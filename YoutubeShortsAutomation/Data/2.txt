Mortal Kombat 1 Shows Off Kameo Fighters in Bone-Krunching Gameplay Trailer 
Mortal Kombat 1 got an extended gameplay trailer at the Summer Game Fest, held early Friday, and it looks absurdly violent in all the right ways. The game serves as a reboot — the beginning of a new timeline in the universe, forged by the Fire God Liu Kang, following his ascension into godhood at the end of Mortal Kombat 11. While recognisable characters return, they all bear new looks and origin stories, with Scorpion and Sub-Zero now being reborn as brothers. The MK franchise creator Ed Boon also dropped by on-stage to describe the new Kameo Fighter system. Mortal Kombat 1 releases September 19 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series S/X, and Nintendo Switch.

Spotify Announces Testing Offline Mix Playlist, May Compete With YouTube in Coming Days 
Spotify CEO Daniel Ek announced that the app is officially testing an offline playlist dictated by the users' recently played favourites. The company first spoke about an offline mix playlist in 2020 but nothing tangible came of it immediately. But it is clear now that the development was in the works behind the screen and it is finally coming to fruition now. Several users claimed on social media to already have access to the feature. It is still unclear whether the Spotify offline mix feature will be free for users or will be a Premium access feature.
